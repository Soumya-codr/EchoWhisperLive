## 💡 The Problem: Why This Matters

Our development was driven by sobering research highlighting the scale of the mental health crisis in the student community:

| Issue | Key Statistics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mental Distress** | 1 in 7 adolescents globally experience mental disorders. (41% depression, 47% anxiety in US college students) |
| **Loneliness** | Affects **17-21%** of young adults worldwide. (36% of students in high-pressure environments like **Kota** feel lonely) |
| **Academic Pressure** | Impacts nearly **44%** of students in high-stakes environments. |
| **Help-Seeking Barrier** | Only 3% of students seek professional help due to stigma. |
